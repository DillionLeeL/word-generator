#wordgenerator.py

Simple program to split words at their vowels and generate random combinations of these parts.
Good for creative writing, placeholder names, brainstorming.

Input: text file of sample words, newline delimited

output: prints 10 generated words

Words are (currently) capped at 5 "parts" and the vowel it is split at goes to the "left" part

ex - "conceptualization" becomes ["co", "nce", "ptu", "a", "li"]
